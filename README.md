### ChatGPT Image Generation
Prompt:
> I made this image with gen ai a few years back, and i really liked the shapes on the helmet, pauldrons and leg protectors, but now i want a version of this armor without the fire and smoke and without the abstract square shading - can you remove the fire and smoke, and give a little more definition to the legs and fingers?

### 3D Model Generation
Using the Hunyuan3D-v2.5 model hosted on [this website](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/) following [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthSqEV2Nt4), output is the "03-Hunyuan3D-V2.5 model.glb" file.
